## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, it’s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 4. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **easy**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

#### Easy Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
  
#### Medium Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
  
#### Advanced Queries
- Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.

### 5. Query Optimization
In advanced stages, the focus shifts to improving query performance. Some optimization strategies include:
- **Indexing**: Adding indexes on frequently queried columns.
- **Query Execution Plan**: Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to review and refine query performance.

## 15 Questions With Query Solutions

### Beginner Level
1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
``` SQL
SELECT * FROM spotify
WHERE stream > 1000000000;

```

2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
``` SQL
SELECT 
DISTINCT album , 
		artist
FROM spotify
ORDER BY 1;

```
3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where `licensed = TRUE`.
``` SQL
SELECT 
SUM(comments) AS total_Comments
FROM spotify
WHERE licensed = 'true';

```
4. Find all tracks that belong to the album type `single`.
``` SQL
SELECT * FROM  spotify
WHERE album_type = 'single';
```
5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.
``` SQL
SELECT artist , COUNT(track)
FROM spotify
GROUP BY artist
ORDER BY count(track) DESC;
```
### Moderate Level
1. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
``` SQL
SELECT 	album,  
        AVG(danceability) 
	AS avg_danceability
FROM spotify
GROUP BY album
ORDER BY AVG(danceability) DESC;

```
2. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
``` SQL
SELECT  track , 
        energy
FROM spotify
ORDER BY energy DESC
LIMIT 5;

```

3. List all tracks along with their views and likes where `official_video = TRUE`.
``` SQL
 SELECT track, 
       SUM(views) AS total_views,
       SUM(likes) AS total_likes
FROM spotify
WHERE official_video = 'true'
GROUP BY track
LIMIT 5;

```
4. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
``` SQL
SELECT album,
       track,
       SUM(VIEWS) AS total_views
FROM spotify
GROUP BY album, track
ORDER BY SUM(views) DESC;

```
5. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.
``` SQL
SELECT * FROM 
(SELECT 
	track, 
	COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(most_played_on) = 'youtube' THEN stream END), 0) AS streamed_on_youtube,
	COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(most_played_on) = 'spotify' THEN stream END), 0) AS streamed_on_spotify
FROM spotify
GROUP BY track) AS T1
WHERE 
streamed_on_youtube > streamed_on_spotify
AND 
streamed_on_spotify <> 0

```
### Advanced Level
1. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
``` SQL
 WITH artist_ranking AS 
(SELECT artist,
        track,
        SUM(VIEWS) AS total_views ,
        DENSE_RANK () OVER(PARTITION BY artist ORDER BY SUM(views) DESC) AS RANK
 FROM spotify
 GROUP BY 1 , 2
 ORDER BY 1 , 3 DESC)
 
 SELECT * FROM artist_ranking
 WHERE RANK <= 3

```

2. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
``` SQL
SELECT 
      artist,
      track,
      liveness
FROM spotify
WHERE liveness > ( SELECT AVG(liveness) FROM spotify);

```

3. Use a `WITH` clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.
```sql
WITH cte
AS
(SELECT 
	album,
	MAX(energy) as highest_energy,
	MIN(energy) as lowest_energery
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
	album,
	highest_energy - lowest_energery as energy_diff
FROM cte
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
   
4. Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.
``` SQL
SELECT track,
       energy / liveness AS ratio_of_energy_to_liveness
FROM spotify
WHERE energy / liveness > 1.2;

```
5. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.
``` SQL
SELECT track,
       views,
       SUM(likes) OVER(ORDER BY views) AS cumulative_sum
FROM spotify
ORDER BY SUM(likes) OVER(ORDER BY views) DESC;

```

## Query Optimization Technique 

To improve query performance, we carried out the following optimization process:

- **Initial Query Performance Analysis Using `EXPLAIN`**
    - We began by analyzing the performance of a query using the `EXPLAIN` function.
    - The query retrieved tracks based on the `artist` column, and the performance metrics were as follows:
        - Execution time (E.T.): **7 ms**
        - Planning time (P.T.): **0.17 ms**
    - Below is the **screenshot** of the `EXPLAIN` result before optimization:
      ![EXPLAIN Before Index](https://github.com/najirh/najirh-Spotify-Data-Analysis-using-SQL/blob/main/spotify_explain_before_index.png)

- **Index Creation on the `artist` Column**
    - To optimize the query performance, we created an index on the `artist` column. This ensures faster retrieval of rows where the artist is queried.
    - **SQL command** for creating the index:
      ```sql
      CREATE INDEX idx_artist ON spotify_tracks(artist);
      ```

- **Performance Analysis After Index Creation**
    - After creating the index, we ran the same query again and observed significant improvements in performance:
        - Execution time (E.T.): **0.153 ms**
        - Planning time (P.T.): **0.152 ms**
    - Below is the **screenshot** of the `EXPLAIN` result after index creation:
      ![EXPLAIN After Index](https://github.com/najirh/najirh-Spotify-Data-Analysis-using-SQL/blob/main/spotify_explain_after_index.png)

- **Graphical Performance Comparison**
    - A graph illustrating the comparison between the initial query execution time and the optimized query execution time after index creation.
    - **Graph view** shows the significant drop in both execution and planning times:
      ![Performance Graph](https://github.com/najirh/najirh-Spotify-Data-Analysis-using-SQL/blob/main/spotify_graphical%20view%203.png)

      ![Performance Graph](https://github.com/najirh/najirh-Spotify-Data-Analysis-using-SQL/blob/main/spotify_graphical%20view%201.png)

This optimization shows how indexing can drastically reduce query time, improving the overall performance of our database operations in the Spotify project.
